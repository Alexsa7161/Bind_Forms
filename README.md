DataGridView, PropertyGrid, BindingNavigator. Elements are linked through an object
BindingSource.
2) Display of images associated with objects; the ability to set an image (for example, when you double-click in the PictureBox window, the OpenFileDialog window opens to
download an image from a file).
3) Loading and saving data in different formats (bin, xml). The file
is selected through a standard window for working with files.
Additional functionality:

from different manufacturers). The grouping indicator belongs to the Enum type.
